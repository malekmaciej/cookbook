## Information
- **Prep Time**: 10 minutes
- **Cook Time**: 15 minutes
- **Total Time**: 25 minutes
- **Servings**: 4
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cuisine**: Italian

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 1 lb (450g) spaghetti
- 6 oz (170g) pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs (room temperature)
- 1 cup (100g) freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

### Optional
- Additional Pecorino Romano for serving
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Bring water to boil**: Fill a large pot with water, salt generously (water should taste like the sea), and bring to a rolling boil.

2. **Prepare the sauce**: While water heats, crack eggs into a bowl. Add grated Pecorino Romano and a generous amount of black pepper. Whisk together until well combined and slightly frothy. Set aside.

3. **Cook pancetta**: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook diced pancetta until crispy and the fat has rendered (about 5-7 minutes). No oil needed - the pancetta will release its own fat. Remove from heat when done.

4. **Cook pasta**: Add spaghetti to boiling water. Cook until al dente according to package directions (usually 8-10 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.

5. **Combine**: Working quickly, add drained hot pasta directly to the skillet with pancetta (off heat). Toss to coat pasta with the rendered fat.

6. **Add egg mixture**: Remove skillet from heat if not already done. Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta while tossing constantly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently, creating a creamy sauce.

7. **Adjust consistency**: Add reserved pasta water, a few tablespoons at a time, tossing constantly, until sauce reaches desired creamy consistency. The sauce should coat the pasta, not pool at the bottom.

8. **Serve immediately**: Divide among warm plates. Top with additional Pecorino Romano and black pepper.

## Tips and Techniques

### Key Success Factors
- **Temperature control**: The eggs should never scramble. Remove pan from heat before adding egg mixture
- **Timing**: Work quickly to combine hot pasta with sauce
- **Room temperature eggs**: They blend more easily and cook more evenly
- **Pasta water**: The starchy water is essential for creating the creamy sauce
- **Toss, don't stir**: Continuous tossing creates a smooth, creamy sauce

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using bacon instead of pancetta/guanciale (flavor won't be authentic)
- ❌ Adding cream (not traditional in carbonara)
- ❌ Scrambling the eggs by having pan too hot
- ❌ Not using enough black pepper
- ❌ Using pre-grated cheese (won't melt as smoothly)

### Ingredient Substitutions
- **Pecorino Romano**: Can use Parmigiano-Reggiano or a 50/50 blend
- **Pancetta**: Guanciale is traditional but hard to find; thick-cut bacon works in a pinch
- **Spaghetti**: Rigatoni, bucatini, or fettuccine also work well

## Variations

### Carbonara with Peas
Add 1 cup frozen peas to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking.

### Carbonara with Mushrooms
Sauté 8 oz sliced mushrooms with the pancetta.

### Lighter Version
Use 2 whole eggs plus 2 egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs.

## Wine Pairing
- Italian white wine like Pinot Grigio or Vermentino
- Light-bodied red like Chianti for red wine lovers

## Cultural Notes

Carbonara is a Roman dish that likely originated in the mid-20th century. The name possibly derives from "carbonaro" (charcoal burner), though its exact origins are debated. 

What's NOT in traditional carbonara:
- No cream
- No garlic
- No onions
- No peas (though popular in some regions)

The beauty of carbonara lies in its simplicity - just a few high-quality ingredients creating an incredibly flavorful dish.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve immediately in warmed bowls
- Accompany with a simple green salad
- Garlic bread on the side
- Finish with fresh black pepper at the table

## Storage
Carbonara is best eaten immediately. The sauce doesn't reheat well as the eggs can become rubbery. If you must store leftovers:
- Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 day
- Reheat gently with a splash of water or milk, stirring constantly
