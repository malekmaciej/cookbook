## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup (2 sticks / 226g) butter, softened
- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup (165g) packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Mix-ins
- 2 cups (340g) chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
- Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.

5. **Combine wet and dry**: Gradually stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. **Add chocolate chips**: Fold in chocolate chips (and nuts if using) until evenly distributed.

7. **Shape cookies**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake**: Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. The centers will look slightly underdone.

9. **Cool**: Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips and Variations

### Storage
- **Room temperature**: Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days
- **Freezer**: Freeze baked cookies for up to 3 months, or freeze cookie dough balls for up to 2 months

### Tips for Success
- Use room temperature butter for best results
- Don't overbake - cookies continue cooking on the hot pan after removal from oven
- For chewier cookies, use more brown sugar
- For crispier cookies, use more white sugar
- Chill dough for 30 minutes if it's too soft to handle

### Variations
- **Double Chocolate**: Replace 1/4 cup flour with cocoa powder
- **White Chocolate Macadamia**: Use white chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts
- **Oatmeal Chocolate Chip**: Add 1 cup rolled oats and reduce flour to 2 cups
- **Sea Salt**: Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top before baking
- **Peanut Butter**: Add 1/2 cup peanut butter to the wet ingredients

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Cookies spread too much**: 
- Chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking
- Make sure butter isn't too soft or melted

**Cookies are too dry**:
- Don't overbake - remove when edges are just golden
- Measure flour correctly (spoon and level, don't pack)

**Cookies are flat**:
- Check baking soda freshness
- Don't overmix the dough
- Make sure oven temperature is accurate

## History

The chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield in the 1930s at the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts. She added chopped chocolate bars to her cookie dough, expecting them to melt and create chocolate cookies. Instead, the chocolate pieces held their shape, creating the first chocolate chip cookies!
